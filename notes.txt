Wedding Colors App

Create account, save pallettes
Allow small tweaks, up to 20%?
Give ability to send/share (for wedding planners/designers), with note (pops up in top of page or in email if through email) ex: "Sarah, this is the first palette I thought I'd share with you, it would really accentuate the outdoor natural tones of your venue"
give individual tweaking to colors, not just scales. indicate what colors have been tweaked, allow them to be reset to original scale color.
